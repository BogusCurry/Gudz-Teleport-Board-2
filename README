This is a complete rewrite of Gudule's 2016 HGBoard, which was an adaptation
of Jeff Kelley' 2010 HGBoard script. Very few of the original code was kept
(except mainly the drawing engine).

The destination list can be set by 3 ways
 - from an external website: put the URL in prim description
 - from a specific notecard: put "card://CardName" in the description
 - fallback if none of the two first method: read the first notecard found.

In previous versions, the destination list used 5 values. We accept this old // format for backward compatibility but we recommand the simplified format:
     Displayed Name|your.grid:port
or   Displayed Name|your.grid:port:Region Name
or   Displayed Name|your.grid:port:Region Name|x,y,z

Empty lines are ignored
Lines commented with "//" are sent as message to the owner and not processed
Lines containing only a string (and no url) are drawn as simple text
Lines containing only a separator ("|") are drawn as an empty line (spacer)

Required OSSL Functions:
   osGetGridGatekeeperURI
